                <h2> Fabricated Science </h2>
                <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic we were all faced with daily questions of who to trust when it came to information.

                <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic we were all faced with daily questions of who to trust when it came to information.

This clearly showed us the importance of being able to rely on well documented research when facing uncertain situations.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In research, trust in the work done by other researchers is essential. Being able to rely on other people&rsquo;s results for your own research, allows research to develop faster and is key in any research community. Research integrity ensures that experiments are well planned, conducted and documented. However, as the tempo in research increases, pressure from multiple sides challenge the good intentions and practices. Reports* shows that researchers generally have good intentions. However, a survey also showed that 33.7% of researchers have been involved in &ldquo;other questionable practices. Whereas when reporting about others, 72% said they had observed &ldquo;other questionable practices&rdquo; by a college [1].</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>How do you do proper research?</em></p>
                <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p><em>Where is the line between good practice and questionable practice in the lab?</em></p>
                <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p><em>How do you deal with questions to research integrity when you are just starting to learn the meaning of being a researcher?</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>At the beginning of our iGEM project, we decided to learn more about how we as a team could ensure that the results, we produced in the lab, could be understood, trusted, and repeated by other teams in the future. We wanted to spread the awareness of the topic and learn along the way.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3 id="link_humanpractices_interviews">Interviews</h3>
      To get even further into the topic and get a better idea about how Freiburg University adresses the topic, we conducted interviews with several professors.<br>
      <br>
<!--______________________Anthony Forster_______________________________ -->
<strong> Professor Anthony Forster </strong><br><br>
After having met Professor Anthony C. Forster at the iGEM European Meetup in Hamburg we found great interest in his work and stand on science. Forster is the university chair in Chemical Biology at the Uppsala University. We were quite interested in his expertise regarding the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Thus, we asked him for an interview. The interview was held on the 8th of July 2022.
First, we followed up on Forster’s statement that “iGEM is not real science” and that some project reports are disingenuous about their achievements. We agreed with this assertion because during our idea-finding phase we had come across some projects by former teams that seemed to be dishonest with their accomplishments.


<br><br><strong>The first part of the interview regarded good scientific practice in the iGEM competition</strong><br><br>
Forster said that the “real science” part about the project depends on how well the project and experiments are documented. Unfortunately, little attention is paid by iGEM itself on to how to create good documentation of experimental data and results, he mentioned. That begs the question, why is this the case? The teams are equipped with almost unlimited storage space on their websites, and <hb>the more documentation you have, the better it is </hb>, Forster pointed out. Thus, the issue lies elsewhere.<br><br>
<hb>iGEM teams need to learn how to create good documentation for their results and experiments.</hb> Forster suggested this could be achieved by a faculty member or institution approving the wiki before it is frozen, as most of the projects are to some extent related to research at the faculty or institution. Otherwise, other experts in the field would have to approve the wiki, Forster proposed, but unpaid peer review for iGEM projects does not appear to be feasible. Other iGEM teams might review wikis before they are frozen, but these teams are most likely not experts in the field that the other team has researched, he stated.<br><br>
Another way to improve documentation would be to push for publications of the iGEM projects, Forster noted. This is supported by the iGEM Foundation itself as seen for example in the “Special Issue on the 2019 and 2020 iGEM proceedings” published by the journal Synthetic and Systems Biotechnology. That an iGEM project ends in a publication is generally appreciated, but whether this is really a feasible goal for every team is questionable. High publication costs and further experiments without access to laboratories could put an end to these plans.<br><br>
Something that could lead to good documentation would be to <hb>encourage new teams to continue working with projects from former teams</hb>, he proposed. There are BioBricks from these former teams which could become more accessible with even better documentation. Subsequently, we suggest good documentation of your experiments and results could become a bronze or silver criterion, which could lead to a suitable change.<br><br>
One thought we as a team genuinely agreed on with Forster was his mention that there is no real “gold medal”. Every competition has the freedom to set its own rules. However, to call something a gold medal, as it is called in other competitions such as the Olympic Games, implies that this gold medal is the first place in the discipline. These terms set false standards for competition and what has been achieved if you are not well acquainted with it.<br><br>
This could lead to a culture of deception, wherein there is a tendency to present great conclusions regardless of whether or not they fit one's experimental data, Forster reckons. Therefore, a rebranding of the “Medal” system is in need. We second Forster's proposal to rename it "Bronze/Silver/Gold Standard".<br><br>
At the moment, a title as well as an abstract must be provided on the team lists website by 30th of September. <hb> This abstract should be presented on the team’s main page </hb>, Forster suggested. As this page is the first point of contact for potentially interested parties, it should also provide a summary of the project at a quick glance. These main pages are very important, so they are mostly filled with animations, impressive structures, and illustrations. It is easy to get lost without quite understanding what the team really achieved.<br><br>
In conclusion, greater focus should be placed on true science itself. Simple implementations to achieve this goal are the mentioned “Medal” criteria for the documentation, the rebranding of the “Medals” into something that isn’t misleading, and the addition of an abstract on the wiki main page.<br><br>

<br><strong>The second part of the interview regarded unnatural amino acids and their use in proteins and peptidomimetics.</strong><br><br>
While we are working on the in vivo incorporation of non-canonical amino acids in bacterial microcompartments, Forster gave us tips on working with ncAAs. He worked with the in vitro incorporation in peptidomimetics and not orthogonally-working synthetases and tRNAs. He started with telling us that ncAA methods can be pretty tricky. He advised us to <hb>focus on just a few amino acids</hb>, since it is already difficult to get some to work, and they can differ greatly in their functions.<br><br>
We also talked about which unnatural amino acids he has already worked with and whether these could also be interesting for us, for example methyl-serine or allyl-glycine. He suggested that we look at various works by Professor Peter G. Schultz, as he has done a lot of work in this field.<br><br>
He told us that one could use directed evolution of libraries for the incorporation of more amino acids or finding interesting positions for the incorporation in target proteins. Unfortunately, this is associated with a considerable investment of time, as one does not know how long it would take to find useful changes in the constellation or interesting positions.<br><br>
We thank Prof. Forster for the interview. It was very inspiring to get another opinion on non-canonical amino acids and to discuss a lot about scientific integrity and good practice.<br><br><br>




<!--______________________Workshop_______________________________ -->

          <h3 id='link_humanpractices_EMBO'>Workshop to research integrity</h2>
          <p>First of all, we wanted to educate ourselves on the topic. This included literature reading and getting familiar with some of the questions and challenges that you can expect face as a researcher.</p>
          <p>While research integrity is surely a personal matter, the whole scientific community plays a great role as well in defining and ensuring integrity. Therefore, we decided that our efforts should not only include our own team, but the whole iGEM community.
          We reached out to EMBO (European Molecular Biology Organisation) for collaborating with us to create a seminar for other interested iGEM teams. For this we contacted Michele Garfinkel who is the Head of the Policy Programme at EMBO and her work focuses on biotechnology, responsible conduct of research, and open science. In the seminar the participants were introduced to research integrity, how to define misconduct and principles of responsibility. The seminar was followed by a discussion session where the participants got a chance to ask follow-up questions.<br><br>
          <p><strong>Take away messages</strong></p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
          <li>What is means to be responsible and work with integrity depends on the community you are in. How things are done might vary from place to place and you therefore need to learn which good practices applies in your field/community.</li>
          <li>Responsible conduct of research is not a moral state, but something you have to learn</li>
          <li>Factors such as high competition, limited funding or short-term funding, pressure to publish, can lead to a negative environment.</li>
          <li>For younger scientists the importance of declaring conflicts of interest is often not clear</li>
          <li>It is important to come together in the scientific community to discuss how to build a good community because changing a culture requires changing the system behind it.</li>
          </ul>

<!--______________________Joachim Boldt_______________________________ -->

              <strong> Professor Joachim Boldt </strong>
              <p>Professeor Joachim Boldt has since 2010 been the deputy director of the institute of Ethics and History of Medicine at University of Freiburg. His research adresses ethical questions regarding eg. synthetical biology, genetherapy, clinical ethics. Furthermore he is a member of the ethic comitee at University of Freiburg.
              With this interview we wanted get some insights on the topic of research integrity from an ethical point of view. </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Important insights:</strong> In the interview we discussed how research integrity presents a problem for the research community when proper performed research is compromised for personal gains. Another example was omittimg to publish negative or less significant results even though they also contain important knowledge beacause they might not get citations nor be accepted by high impact journals. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <i>"The problem is also in the background of how we measure scientific excellence"</i>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>From this perspective Professor Joachim Boldt points to that blaming the individual commiting the fraud is not the complete solution. While fraud should have consequences he also mentions the importance of aknowledging that the academic system also carries a part of the reponsibility.</p>
              <br><i>" [...] I think part of the problem really is how do we measure how good research is and we do measure often along the lines of quantitative statistics"</i>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We also discussed which measures we can take, as an iGEM team, to adress problems of research integrity and measuring of scientific excellence.</p>
              <br><i>"I would also encourage you to be part of the processes and decisions at your faculty and at your institutions to realise and rethink the way in which we measure who is worth of becoming a professor or get a permanent position" </i><br><br>

                  <p><strong>Speaker 1 (Nikita Edel iGEM2022)</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />So, today's interview is about the topic of Research integrity and fake science. And for a beginning we wanted to start with an interesting game we had in our ethics lectures. It's called the dilemma game. And we wanted to have one question out of the dilemma game. You maybe can read it here.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />So, this scenario is:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;After a couple of rounds of reviews, I discover an error omission in data analysis in a co-authored manuscript. At this point, the paper has almost been accepted and the reviewers have never made any remark about the data analysis. I know that my co-authors do not want to miss out on a chance to publish. I was not the prime person responsible for this part of the data analysis. What do I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />And now you want me to answer the question? Well, this is a real test because you haven't shown the example to me beforehand, so I'm really answering out of my mind. So, the first thing to do is I would talk to my colleagues about my observation. There seems to be an omission, maybe I'm wrong. You never know. Maybe I have misread myself. What was written there, so contact the co-authors, talked to them about it, and if that actually is an error or an omission, then contact the editor of the journal pointing to this problem and asking to come for an opportunity to either correct the manuscript or have a supplement included with the correct Datasheet, or something like that but that should be no problem at all, I guess.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong><br />Good. So the first question would be what does that mean for you if we talk about research integrity or fake science?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Yeah, so the question for me would always be what kind of ethical mistake or act would that be? What sort of principles would be neglected and how serious is this issue? What is at stake in in the ethical meaning of the term, uhm, and the answer would be I guess, multifold. because research integrity has different purposes.&nbsp;<br />One, of course, and perhaps the most important one is that you want the results to be reliable, you want others to be in a position to be able to also to perform the same experiments to confirm the results.&nbsp;<br />Uh, so it has to do with the reliability of your research results, which then in the end, yeah, it's part of the whole progress of science and progress of knowledge, and that of course is an ethical value. We want science to progress because that means more knowledge. That means more ability for us to improve on the ways we make use of our resources and so on and so forth.&nbsp;<br />It's about societal progress, so that's one issue, but another one, I guess, also of course, has to do with relations to colleagues with trust, uh, with people not playing with open cards to others and so on and so forth. So, it also has this relational aspect I guess, and there may be others as well, yeah. <hb>So, I guess it's a multifold issue with the most important one being we want science to be a reliable source.</hb>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />And in that meaning, what ethical problems may arise in the scientific community if someone does research misconduct, so doesn't follow the rules?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Well, one of course is that you spread mistrust and that people tend not to believe each other anymore. If you know that a certain percentage of people is fraudulently misrepresenting their results. Then of course you will always be on the watch, and you will perhaps not so easily share your own data with others and so on and so forth. <hb>So, the middle or long term effect of this conduct being something more or less frequent will be that cooperation, scientific cooperation will become more difficult and more reluctant, and that will have an adverse effect on scientific progress as a whole</hb>, and we don't want that. Yeah, so that I guess is the main issue.&nbsp;<br />Besides all those individual issues of people advancing their careers on the cost of others because they have some great publications, perhaps due to their fake data that others don't have. Maybe they have a greater number of papers available, so there are all those systemic effects. The problem is also in the background of <hb>how we measure scientific excellence</hb>. And people can, if they fake their measures, then they can advance their own careers, take advantage of those who are the honest ones.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />How to find out how excellent is research? And again, this is not what we want of course, from an ethical point of view. So those individual collegial issues also play a role, of course.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Uh, ok, so maybe taking it to a wider view. There are certainly some cases, for example of manipulation of medical studies, where this manipulation doesn't only affect the scientific community itself, but it affects the general public. So, do you think the problem is bigger or the same for the general public as it is for the scientific community?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Well, general public. Also, with regard to medical studies, well, the first ones to suffer from bad research in that case would be patients. And of course, patients are part of the general public, but they are not the complete general public.&nbsp;<br />But again, you're right. I mean, we have a special responsibility to protect patients, vulnerable groups in general, from, yeah, from bad effects of bad research.&nbsp;<br />I'm not so sure though, that medical research poses a special problem. Of course, it's true if we have wrong data, manipulated data in medical research, that will be a problem for patients immediately. If it is research that is concerned with some form of therapies, diagnosis, diagnostic tools or therapeutic medicine or anything along those lines.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Uh, but I would guess that at that stage, maybe I'm a bit too optimistic there, but at that stage the regulatory framework that we have imposed on study results, on publications, on clinical study, design and so on and so forth is so tight. Of course, there's no guarantee that nothing bad can happen, but it's a much tighter framework compared to other areas of science and scientific research, so I would actually think that, and for good reasons, of course, the danger of having a medicine or diagnostic tool that is actually dangerous for patients, the danger as a result of manipulated data is not very big.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />If we take it out again to biology and for example, with the background of Corona, we of course have I think a nice scenario where I wouldn't say fake data, but just the trust in science isn't as big as it should be, or as we expected. Do you think that fake science could lead to that the general public loses the trust in the science?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I think, of course there's always this kind of danger, yeah? At least I don't think that single events of manipulated research will have a measurable effect on public trust in research, I don't think so. But if you imagine that we would have a roll of those events becoming, then of course there would be a danger that public trust is lost. And of course you know for good reasons <hb>I might also lose trust in in scientific research if yeah, if I realise &ldquo;Oh well, every new week a new manipulated research turns up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</hb><br/>So of course, there will always be a danger lurking in the background. I don't think that also with regard to Corona now that public distrust, if there was something like that, and there's certainly worse in some areas of society, that this kind of distrust had so much to do with manipulated or fraudulent research. I think there was other reasons why people begin to doubt scientific advice.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We know you're a member of the Ethics Committee and for medicine here in Freiburg and we just wanted to ask, does the Ethics Committee have something to do with cases of misconduct or like that?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />No, not this kind of ethics Commission. There are different kinds of all sorts of ethics, commissions and councils and committees, and so on and so forth.So really, I think at least at the level of institutions such as the university you find all sorts of those ethics committees.&nbsp;<br />The Ethics Committee you were referring to is the one who is concerned with research concerning humans or involving humans, which means medical research in the 1st place. But it can also be research in social sciences involving humans, human participants. And the only task of this Ethics Committee is to uh, to sample all sorts of documents concerning this planned research and then to cheque it whether it's appears to be ethically reasonable and acceptable or not, and then send it back to the applicant and say please, well, change some details of your methodology or right, uh, better patient information sheet or something like that or just say well it looks fine everything, go ahead.&nbsp;<br />So, it's really an application cheque procedure and it doesn't have anything to do with data manipulation issues.&nbsp;<br />The Freiburg University does have some sort of ethics group who would be concerned with those issues, but that would be as far as I know, and I'm not a part of that group, so I'm not 100% sure how it works, but as far as I know they will be alerted if some suspicion turns up that there has been fraud in research, and then they will be called together and cheque this individual case.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Uh, there is at the University Hospital a clinical ethics group of which I am a part where we assist physicians and healthcare workers in ethically demanding situations in patient care. And there is an Ethics Committee, of which I'm also a part at the university, which is concerned with dual use, research of concern, which is a new one. We will have to find out how working procedures actually will be and so on and so forth. So, there's really a broad and diverse landscape of such ethics committees, each with its own way of working and its own task.&nbsp;<br />The one having to do with fraudulent research really is, as far as I know, dependent on someone else raising suspicion about some sort of research. You know it doesn't cheque by itself, you know, is everything OK? At our university, there's no watchdog sitting in checking publications from Freiburg University for wrong data uses or something like that.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Of course, we as an iGEM-team also want to know how could we as young researchers in general educate ourself? Or how could we ensure that we as a group act more ethically and maybe with more integrity?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One way actually, I think would be to become aware of how the systemic framework in some senses also makes possible or even induces fake research. And I've mentioned that before because<hb> I think part of the problem really is how do we measure how good research is </hb> and we do measure often along the lines of quantitative statistics:&nbsp;<br />How many publications? How great was the impact factor where the publication was published, and then you have the numbers, and it looks very objective because you appear to be able to calculate who's the best? But the problem with this always is that you can try to publish many, many papers and try to of course to publish them in high rank journals. And you can enhance these measures by using or by producing fake science if you do it cleverly.&nbsp;<br />In medicine, for example, one effect of those measures is that many people cited as authors may actually not be authors or only in very minor roles involved in in the paper published.&nbsp;<br />So that&rsquo;s one of the problems, but another one, of course, is you produce your own data with some very spectacular results in order to be able to publish in high rank journals. Bad effect would be the publishing of negative results. You had a hypothesis, and it couldn't be confirmed by your experiments, which is also important for scientific. But try to publish such a result in a high rank journal. It's not possible. Nobody is interested in those kinds of results. They are too boring.&nbsp;<br />And if you as an individual cannot resist these temptations, then of course, there's a danger you know, that you will turn into a bad scientist and produce your own data or do other bad things.&nbsp;<br />And I think really, of course you can then blame the individual and say, ah, you are bad. You have done something ethically wrong. We don't want that, and of course that's also right and we should, I guess, blame this person.  Also do that, but on the other hand <hb> we should not forget that the whole situation is part of the way in in which we organise our scientific system.&nbsp;</hb><br />So, I would actually advise you to first be aware of those systemic effects in order to be able as individual to resist and say <hb>&ldquo;I will not do that. That's not good, even though I know I will have an individual perhaps advantage of producing fraud research, I would not do it anyway&rdquo;.&nbsp;</hb><br />But at the same time, I would also <hb>encourage you to be part of the processes and decisions at your faculty and at your institutions to realise and rethink the way in which we measure who is worth of becoming a professor or get a permanent position and so on and so forth.</hb> So, remake those institutional structures, I think, really, that's an important issue for us at the moment.&nbsp;<br />There's no perfect solution, but we need other ways of how to measure who is a good scientist and who isn't.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />So, at the end we wanted, just because we are a really big fan of this dilemma game, we wanted as a closing to have another question. But this time you have the normal four answer answers you could give. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;When screening my data, I find that there is one extreme observation. What do I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />A would be: &ldquo;Nothing, it's a part of theoretical sample for a reason.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />B: &ldquo;Look for information on the observation. Trying to find qualitative reasons for the defiance. If there is a good explanation for its position, it must be a niche observation since it's part of my theoretical sample, I leave it in. However, if there is no explanation for its position, I leave it out as it is there either due to measurement error or responsive response bias.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> </strong>C: &ldquo;I look for information on the observation, trying to find qualitative reasons for the divines. If there is a good explanation for its position, it must be an issue observation, despite my theoretical sampling, there is no place for such anomalous observations, so I leave it out if there is no explanation. If there is no explanation. For this position, I'll leave it in to avoid potential sampling bias.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />D.: &ldquo;I'll let the colleague review the data and follow her advice, whatever it is.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> PD Dr. Joachim Boldt</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Yeah, D is easy, uh, because you don't have any responsibility for what follows.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Then I'm not a researcher using quantitative measures myself, so this is methodology speaking unknown alien terrain for me. But as an immediate answer, I would say well, whatever you screen as your data you have to work with. You have sampled those data, you get it, you screen it. So, of course you leave everything in and then maybe in the discussion section or conclusion section you would point to this special data point or something like that and make some arguments why this is an interesting observation. Why this is interesting data or why it isn't? Why it could also be left out and so on and so forth, but this reasoning should be part of a transparent heart of your published research.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This is, I think, what I would say, so, leave it in and discuss it and then all your colleagues can cheque it and come up with their own assumptions and maybe reiterate the expense or have their own data sampled and see whether this phenomenon turns up again or not. And then the question &ldquo;Is this data point reliable or not?&rdquo;, is left to the scientific community to be answered and not to your own individual reasoning about whether this is OK or not.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong> Nikita Edel</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you very much. I think that would be it.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>

<!--______________________van der Does_______________________________ -->
                <br><br><strong> Professor Chris Van der Does </strong><br><br>
                Professor Chris van der Does has been a senior scientist and group leader at Freiburg university since 2014. Besides, doing research in microbiology he is also teaching the ethic course for biology bachelor students. With this interview we wanted to get to know how researchers address problems and issues regarding research integrity and if which role teaching on this subject should play in the biology programme.
                <p><strong>Important insights:</strong> In this interview we overall discussed which responsibilities you as a researcher or student have in regards of preventing misconduct. We also discussed that having an ethics course once in your bachelors does not provide sufficient training in the field of research integrity. Ideally, discussions about integrity and ethics should reoccur also in the masters, pHD and as a part of the work discussions in your work group:</p>
                <p><em>&ldquo;as a supervisor you really have to learn your students how to read papers, how to check if the proper controls are there&rdquo;</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In this case the Professors have a responsibility to pass on critical thinking and regularly discuss what well presented data and good conducted research look like. Another responsibility which Prof. van der Does pointed out, is to create an open working environment, where the students are not afraid to tell if they have made a mistake:</p>
                <p><em>&ldquo; for me it's always important in the lab that if mistakes are made that you are not too strict on people that make the mistakes so they are not afraid to come to you to tell them&rdquo;</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>However, there are also several responsibilities which you as a student have to be aware of. One of those is to find a group where you feel comfortable and have good communication with the professor.</p>
                <p><em>&ldquo;I tell master students who are looking for a group where they want to do their pHD: make sure that you have a supervisor where you have the feeling that you can say something like this&rdquo;</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We also discussed which effects might cause scientists to publish fake science. One of the things which are very known is the pressure to publish:&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>&ldquo;If you don't publish are essentially out&rdquo;</em></p><br>

                <div class="scroll_box">
                  <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg </span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">We are the iGEM team from Freiburg. This year we want to address the topic, research integrity and fake science and we want to ask different stakeholders about their experiences and learn how to address research integrity and in general learn more about the topic of research integrity. As a first question for you, we wanted to ask you what consider good scientific practice?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does </span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">So I've been thinking for a longer time on this and I've also tried to look the internet for a nice definition and the one I like the most is:</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto"><hb>Honesty to yourself and to other researchers.</hb></span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">I think that very simply defines for me, scientific integrity. That you know with yourselves, that you're honest. You're honest to other people. I think if you follow that rule then normally you are, 100% of the cases, OK. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a very long definition. But I think the one that is just honesty is the most important one for me personally. Well, I also looked at the European code of research integrity which is published, I think that every 10 years they make a new one and the latest one they mentioned actually four different topics. One of them is again, honesty. The other one is reliability. That you make sure that you can reproduce things. The other one is respect for colleagues, then that you are honest to other people, and accountability. That you perform the experiments also in an ecological sociological perfect way, but for me I think they all come back to honesty. <hb>I mean I think most scientists want to do their best and find something new and be honest about that.</hb></span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg </span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Ok, so next we want to have short question game. You maybe know the dilemma game already because we had it in in your ethic lectures. We choose this question &ldquo;so close&rdquo; I can read it out loud one time.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">After a couple of rounds of reviews, I discover a narrow omission in data analyst analysis in the core offered manuscript. At this point, the paper has almost been accepted and the reviewers have never made any remark about the data analysis. I know that my Co-authors do not want to miss out on a chance to publish. I was not the prime person responsible for this part of the data analysis. What do I what do I do? And we left out the answer options this time because we really want to have an open answer on this.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">This is for me a very easy questions, I will immediately tell everybody that I found this. Actually, I have to remark that it will be different because I'm a scientist that is further in his career. So for me, if I miss out, I have 80 papers it's not such a big problem for me. <hb>Of course, if you are a PhD and it is your first paper, I can imagine that this is more difficult.</hb> But I always say this is so incredibly damaging to your career. It is better to have a setback for a few months, and I would always say it and say it as fast as you can. The moment you discover it, you have to, if you don't, the problems get bigger and bigger. So, in this case I would say sorry, OK, we've almost had this paper accepted, but this is not OK. We need to correct it and also immediately inform the editor that that you solve this.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">You spoke already about in the position of a PhD. It will get more difficult because it might be the first paper, so. If the authors are maybe also more advanced in their careers and they refuse to see that as a as an error, what could you do as a PhD?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto"> Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">I understand that it's very difficult, but I think it is really important that we learn our students that they make a point against the supervisor. I tell master students who are looking for a group where they want to do their pHD: <hb>make sure that you have a supervisor where you have the feeling that you can say something like this</hb>. Yeah, we know that there are extremely good groups. Where the head professor is very direct and his it's his way and it's the only way. I would try to avoid these groups, because I think those are the kinds of groups where these mistakes happen. We need to have a professor that pushes you, we need to have a professor that is strict with you but you also need to have a professor that listens to you and if you have concerns you need to be sure that this is OK. Yeah, and I think this is also an answer to your question. Always be honest. Because it's science. <hb>You will make mistakes, everybody makes mistakes.</hb> At a certain moment you will find out if you make a mistake. Yeah, you will feel bad that you made a mistake, but immediately tell your supervisor. If you wait a week, it gets more difficult. If you wait month, it gets more difficult. The longer you wait, the more difficult it becomes to correct this mistake, and if it's published it's even more difficult. First of all, make sure that you tell it, and second of all, make sure you have a supervisor to whom you can tell it.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">What might be other factors that especially budding scientists in particular, lead them into falsifying their work?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, I think you mentioned it a little bit, I think only for budding scientists, of course, you want to have your first few publications, and I think that even goes to people in their post doc, people that have their first group. I think the pressure is incredibly high to publish. We discuss it also in the lectures. I mean, it's publish or perish. If you don't publish are essentially out. And I have to say how to get over this except for being honest to yourself, I don't really know. <hb>I see the pressure in some people, and sometimes you really think that you can understand why somebody would be tempted to do something like this.</hb> But there are disadvantages of doing it because it will always be found out. We need to make sure in the scientific community that the disadvantages of being found out are bigger than the advantages of doing something like this.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">OK, and a little bit more personal because you have already a lot of experience. You have already worked many years as a scientist. Did you also experience or come in contact with fake science yourself and when? How did you deal with that?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, I think every scientist will meet situations and I'm sure that you will also meet situations where another group has performed experiments and you just can&rsquo;t repeat that. Then there is always the question; is that then fake science or are you doing something wrong? There I find it very difficult to say something. For example, a paper was published. And two years later you look at the paper and you notice that the figure from this paper is the same as that was used two years ago.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, that's done in a group which you are befriended to. And then you found out that the PhD had left for two years. When they asked for the for the figure, they just they just picked from their data. So, they picked the figure that they thought were correct so it's not on purpose, but it's of course it's a mistake, yeah, and it means it just needs to be corrected. If you find that, you need to go to the journal. Nobody else has seen it, but I found myself saying that this picture is wrong. We need to replace them and then you get a correction. Which is maybe negative, but you always need to do that.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">And other examples that I've seen is that. That during or after the PhD defense. It's found out that large pieces of text have been copied from other papers. You very often have a beginning pHD student that doesn't really know how to write nicely. Then of course if you have a perfect text somewhere else you just copy that into the introduction. That doesn't feel so bad of course, as copying results. Which is of course really bad, but also your introduction, you should write yourself. Those are things that unfortunately I've seen happen to people. Fortunately, that was always caught before published, never after publication, but even before publication that that should never happen. And especially with the methods. Nowadays, I think there are so many plagiarism cheques. If you do it, you will be found out. </span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">OK, so you already spoke now about a few tips you would have for budding scientists. Do you have some tips in general, for when we, as an iGEM team come into a critical dilemma situation regarding fake science.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Be honest to yourself. <hb>Be honest to your supervisor and if you or supervisor doesn't listen, go to somebody else.</hb></span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Yeah, or even here when you see me in the ethics lecture come to me, then I can help you go to the Ombudsman or something because I realise that as a master or bachelor student it is really difficult to step up to your professor. But you just need to do that. Because this might follow you the rest of your life. You publish something that is wrong or you write something in your masters thesis where you know it is wrong. In the end people will find out.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">And another point we mentioned already that you are teaching. You teach the ethics lectures for example, but also I know from the bachelor you also teach in other courses and so on. Does the topic of fake science and research integrity play a role in your teaching?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, in teaching it's very clear. I think it's critical that all students listen to that lecture. And I think also I actually think that it's important that we will give that lecture again for the PhD students. That we've all really heard that. I think the other point where it's important to teach to people is when they do their bachelor studies. When they do their masters. So that you discuss with your students, the plagiarism value, the falsification. Before I mentioned, take a supervisor that listens to you and for me I would say. Then <hb>be a supervisor, who people think will listen to them.</hb> For me it's always important in the lab that if mistakes are made that you are not too strict on people that make the mistakes so they are not afraid to come to you to tell them. If people are afraid to tell you their mistakes. This is what it is, but you are on the border of scientific fraud I would say.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">What further role could it also play? Or should it play in teaching? For example, other lecture alert lectures than ethics. So for example you mentioned before the bachelor thesis maybe, but should it also play a bigger role generally in the bachelor thesis or studies.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">I think as I work here, I think what we do with our good scientists practice lecture. I think that's enough for the bachelor. Like it, I think, especially in the master thesis it should come back again. And in your work discussions, you should give examples of things by other groups where you don't agree. <hb>As a supervisor you really have to learn your students how to read papers, how to check if the proper controls are there.</hb> Almost every supervisor does that, but that's an essential part, detecting fake science.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Jonas iGEM Freiburg</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">We want to go to schools this summer and make a small lecture about fake science and research integrity to spread a bit more awareness about this important topic. How can one make other people more aware of fake science? </span><span data-contrast="auto">What tips do we have, especially for teaching that topic?</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Because we can happily use my lecture. You want to give that stuff. That's, of course. And I think it's. I think you wake up people to. These kind of things if you give them examples from the real world. In the lectures I discussed Andrew Wakefield, the &ldquo;impfgegner&rdquo; [vaccine skeptic] I think people always forget how many things he did wrong in his publication and I think just the list of the 14 things he did that are against proper scientific good scientific conduct. I think that makes it clear.</span>&nbsp;<br /><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                  <p>&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">So now we are nearly at the end of the interview and we have another dilemma game question for you and it goes about outliers. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I can read it out one more time. It's called when screening my data. I find that there's one extreme observation. What do I? There are four possible answers.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">a) Nothing, it is part of my theoretical sample for a reason.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">b) I look for information on observation, trying to find qualitative reasons for the deviation. Is there a good explanation for its position? It must be a niche observation since it is a part of my theoretical sample. I leave it in. However, if there's no explanation for its position. I leave it out as it is there either to my measurement error or response bias.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">c) I look for an information on the observation, trying to find qualitative reasons for the deviation. If there's a good explanation for its position, it must be niche observation despite by theoretical sampling, but there's no place for such anomalies observation so I leave it out. If there is no explanation for its position, I leave it in to avoid potential sampling bias</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">d) Let a colleague review the data and follow her advice, whatever it is.</span>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Prof. Van der Does</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span data-contrast="auto">Now the good answer is of course: A) yeah, it's part of the data set, and you should just keep it in. So sometimes it happens that you have one point that really lies out and I would say I would only take it out if before I take the point, I already have the feeling that something is wrong with the sample, but if I notice that the point is wrong only after I've done the experiment, then I keep it in, then it stays part of the sample and it just means that you have to repeat the experiment more often to get the error bars smaller again. That's science.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
